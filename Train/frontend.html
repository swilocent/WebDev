            Hello World! My web development journey starts now. <br />
            And this is written in a paired tag
        </p>
            
        <h> What is an element?</h>
        <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. 
            <br>It represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title 
            <br>element represents the title of the document. Most HTML elements 
            <br>are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag 
            <br>(or closing tag), with content in between.
        </p>

        <h>What is a tag?</h>
        <p>HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define 
            <br>how your web browser must format and display the content. 
            <br>Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. 
            <br>Note that the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, 
            <br>but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character
